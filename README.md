# ia_math
My IB Diploma IA for HL Math, on the topic of the lambda calculus.

I previously started drafting my IA on the topic of fractals such as the Mandelbrot, however after discovering that many other students were researching the same topic I abandoned that project and shifted to focusing on the lambda calculus. The code I wrote for fractal generation can be found [here](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/fractals).

## Files
* `ia.tex` - Main typesetting document. LaTeX markup for IA.
* `research.bib` - BibTeX-notated bibliography.
* `instructions/initial.txt` - Text of initial instructions offered for assignment. Posted on Schoology by my AP BC Calculus instructor, Ms. Jayson.
* `instructions/revision.txt` - Email sent by Ms. Jayson giving advice for general improvements students ought to make. Sent to all students in my class, so not terribly specific to my own work.
