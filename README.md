# ia_math
My IB Diploma IA for HL Math, on the topic of the lambda calculus.

I previously started drafting my IA on the topic of fractals such as the Mandelbrot, however I abandoned that project and shifted to focusing on the lambda calculus. The code I wrote for fractal generation can be found [here](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/fractals).
